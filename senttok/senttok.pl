# Return the Levenshtein distance (also called Edit distance) 
# between two strings
#
# The Levenshtein distance (LD) is a measure of similarity between two
# strings, denoted here by s1 and s2. The distance is the number of
# deletions, insertions or substitutions required to transform s1 into
# s2. The greater the distance, the more different the strings are.
#
# The algorithm employs a proximity matrix, which denotes the distances
# between substrings of the two given strings. Read the embedded comments
# for more info. If you want a deep understanding of the algorithm, print
# the matrix for some test strings and study it
#
# The beauty of this system is that nothing is magical - the distance
# is intuitively understandable by humans
#
# The distance is named after the Russian scientist Vladimir
# Levenshtein, who devised the algorithm in 1965
